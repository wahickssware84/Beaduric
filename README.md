# Project Description
bretwalda-alpha is a single-player, text-based strategy game set in seventh-century northwestern Europe wherein the player must carefully manage their limited troops and resources in order to defeat their rivals in simulated battles.
(CONTEXT: This repository was planned, created, & developed by a college student to refine basic programming skills in Java).
# Gameplay (How to Play)
// NOTHING HERE YET
# Mechanics (How to Win)
The outcome of a given battle is calculated/determined using Lanchester's square law (Archers) and Lanchester's linear law (Infantry/Cavalry). 
N.B. While Lanchester's laws will invariably determine the initial rate of attrition (rateOfAttrition), other factors - particularly CULTURE, MORALE, and ENVIRONMENT - will also play crucial roles in calculating the final outcome of a given battle (battleResult).
# Planned Features
*(upon initiating combat) generate real-time descriptions of the player's environment; the player must know this information in order to adjust their tactics accordingly.
