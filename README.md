# Mechanics (How to Win)
The outcome of a given battle is initially calculated using Lanchester's square law (for ARCHERS) and Lanchester's linear law (for INFANTRY). While Lanchester's laws will invariably determine the initial rate of attrition (double rateOfAttrition), other factors - particularly CULTURE, MORALE, and ENVIRONMENT - will also play a crucial role when calculating the final outcome of a given battle (battleResult)).
