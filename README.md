# Mechanics (How to Win)
The outcome of a given battle is initially calculated using Lanchester's square law (for ARCHERS) and Lanchester's linear law (for INFANTRY). While Lanchester's laws will invariably determine the initial rate of attrition, other factors, such as morale and environment, will also play a crucial role when calculating the final outcome of a battle.

// N.B. Morale is ultimately determined by 2 sets of factors: 
A. small attack bonus IF the Army in question is in the appropriate stance (based on whether or not the environment aligns with the player's cultural bonuses) AND 
B. The difference (ratio) in manpower between the two armies.
# Features
// Generate real-time descriptions of the local environment upon engaging an enemy army; the player must know this information in order to adjust their tactics accordingly.

// Difficulty settings - Easy, Normal, Hard, and Very Hard. In Easy difficulty, all affected variables will be skewed in the player's favor. In Hard difficulty, all affected variables will be skewed in the enemy's favor. In Normal difficulty, all variables will remain unaffected. In Very Hard difficulty, the enemy will have a larger manpower pool than the player, in addition to the other aforementioned malefactors.
